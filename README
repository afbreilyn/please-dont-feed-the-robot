This is a music application/project using chucK (http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), MAXMSP (http://cycling74.com/products/max/), and Processing (http://www.processing.org/) to create a pitch detecting robot. It uses a fuzzy logic algorithm to predict likely room tones and voice pitches, and has a xylophone playing robot "accompany" whatever it hears. Using Processing, there is a graphical element, where each pitch is assigned a colour, and represented as a growing and changing mist.
