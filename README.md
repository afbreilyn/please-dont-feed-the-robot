# PLEASE DON'T FEED THE ROBOT: 

Please Don't Feed The Robot is a multimedia project I built throughout the 2012-2013 school year. It was a featured installation at the CalArts Digital Arts Exposition in May of 2013. 

It was written in [chucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), [Processing](http://www.processing.org/), and [MAX/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/), using a xylophone-playing robot created by [Ajay Kapur](http://www.ajaykapur.com/). 

## Features

* Uses a custom created, fuzzy-logic based, pitch detection/prediction algorithm.
* Employs chucK to control the robot in response to room noises
* Creates a 30 second recursive sound buffer with filters using MAX/MSP
* Projected graphics were controlled in Processing, and the colours responded to the average pitch of the room, calculated over the last 30 seconds
